# Twins

Game made in Rust for the [Weekly Game Jam](http://www.weeklygamejam.com/),
which definitely didn't made the deadline. 

Also will be an attempt to experiment with a game engine called
[Mursten](https://github.com/teglvaerk/mursten).

## Howtorunthis?

Currently you will need rust installed and will have to compile the executable
yourself. Sounds complicated but is pretty simple actually.

In a terminal run:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh  # This will prompt for installation options
git clone git@github.com:Jbat1Jumper/Twins.git twins
cd twins
cargo run
```

If you are on windows you may need to download rust from https://rustup.rs/
